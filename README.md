bag_finder: uses bag handle coordinates to move turtlebot, and when the turtle is close enough, it moves the arm to the location of the handle.

chair_finder: rotates turtle to face an empty chair

# WARNING: I made the nodes here in an existing package on my laptop (faceReco) instead of making my own package (lazy, I know). If you want to test anything just put it in a package. Also make sure to run chmod -x "scriptname.py" for each script you wanna run.
